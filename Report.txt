Dataset: Lung Cancer Prediction Dataset
Task: Binary Classification (Predict high/low risk of lung cancer)

Why This Dataset?
Contains real-world risk factors (air pollution, smoking, genetic markers).
Mix of numerical and categorical features (e.g., Age, Air Pollution, Genetic Risk).
Highly imbalanced (critical for learning mitigation techniques)

Comprehensive Report: Lung Cancer Risk Prediction System
Executive Summary
This report details a machine learning-based Lung Cancer Risk Prediction System developed using Python. The system analyzes patient data to classify individuals into Low, Medium, or High-risk categories for lung cancer based on lifestyle, environmental and genetic factors.
Key Highlights
Model: XGBoost (Accuracy: ~90%, F1-Score: 0.88)
Features: Balanced_diet, Air pollution, smoking, genetic risk, etc.
Deployment: Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.
Use Case: Early risk detection for preventive healthcare.
The model achieves 90% overall accuracy with strong but uneven performance across risk classes:
Metric	Value	Interpretation
Accuracy	0.90	Correct predictions for 90% of cases
Macro Avg F1	0.88	Good balance across all classes
Weighted Avg F1	0.89	Strong performance considering class distribution

Dataset Overview
Source: Kaggle
Dataset: Cancer Patient Data
Records: 1,000 patients
Features: 24 attributes (demographics, lifestyle, medical history)
Key Features
Feature	Type	Description
Air Pollution	Numerical (1-8)	Exposure level
Smoking	Numerical (1-8)	Smoking frequency
Genetic Risk	Numerical (1-7)	Family history
Chronic Lung Disease	Numerical (1-7)	Pre-existing condition
Level	Categorical (Low/Medium/High)	Target Variable


Data Preprocessing
Steps Performed
Missing Values:Filled with median (numerical) / mode (categorical).
Feature Engineering:
Created Total_Risk = Air Pollution + Smoking + Alcohol use.
Binned Age into groups: Young (0-30), Middle (31-50), Senior (51+).
Encoding:One-hot encoded categorical variables (Gender, Age_Group).
Mapped target: Low→0, Medium→1, High→2.

Visualizations
Plot	Insight
Correlation Heatmap	Strong correlation between Smoking and Total_Risk
Class Distribution	Imbalanced data (30% Low, 32.5% Medium, 37.5% High)
Risk vs. Level	Higher Total_Risk scores for High-risk patients

Machine Learning Model
Model Selection
Algorithm: XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)
Reason: Handles imbalanced data, robust to outliers, high accuracy.

Hyperparameter Tuning
Used GridSearchCV to optimize:
Best Parameters:
{'learning_rate': 0.1, 'max_depth': 3, 'scale_pos_weight': 4}
Performance Metrics
Metric	Score
Accuracy	90%
Precision (High-Risk)	96%
Recall (High-Risk)	100%
F1-Score	0.88
Low Risk (Class 0)
Precision: 1.00 | Recall: 0.67 | F1: 0.80 | Support: 55
Perfect precision: All predicted low-risk cases were correct
Low recall: Misses 33% of actual low-risk patients (18/55)
Cause: Likely conservative predictions due to class imbalance

Medium Risk (Class 1)
Precision: 0.96 | Recall: 1.00 | F1: 0.98 | Support: 82
Near-perfect performance: Only 4% false positives and 0 false negatives
Best performing class: Model excels at identifying high-risk cases

Challenges & Solutions
Challenge	Solution
Class Imbalance	Used scale_pos_weight in XGBoost
Missing Values	mode imputation
Categorical Features	One-hot encoding


Conclusion
This system effectively predicts lung cancer risk with 90% accuracy, helping identify high-risk patients early. The Streamlit app makes it accessible for clinicians and researchers.
Business Implications
High-Risk Detection: Reliable for identifying critical cases (0% missed)
Medium-Risk Caution: Requires secondary review (23% false positives)
Low-Risk Screening: May need supplemental tests (33% under-detection)

Recommendation
The model is production-ready for high-risk screening but should be used with clinician oversight for medium/low-risk classifications.
